## SSDI Symptom Tracker: App Identity Statement

### What This App Is

- A personal SSDI evidence compiler
- A professional-grade documentation tool for disability claims
- Designed for trust, clarity, and repeatability
- Focused on functional impact, pattern consistency, and narrative documentation
- Built for people with disabilities and their advocates

### What This App Is NOT

- Not a mass-market wellness or engagement app
- Not a social platform (no sharing, no social features)
- Not optimized for growth, engagement metrics, or retention
- Not a medical diagnosis or treatment tool
- Not a data collection tool for third parties

### Design Priorities

- Evidence integrity and auditability
- User privacy and local data control
- Deterministic, explainable analysis
- Accessibility and professional documentation standards
- No silent logic drift: all core rules are frozen and require explicit approval to change

### Next Steps

- No new features unless required for compliance or credibility
- No architectural refactoring for its own sake
- No loosening of invariants to "make AI smarter"
- Only bug fixes and hardening allowed before release
