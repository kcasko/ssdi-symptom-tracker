## Data Storage Location

All data is stored using:

- **SecureStore** (Optional): Encrypted storage if you enable encryption

**Storage Location**: Your device's private app directory, inaccessible to other apps.

## Data Security

### Encryption Options

- **Optional Encryption**: You can enable device-level encryption in Settings
- **Biometric Protection**: Optional biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID)
- **No Network Transmission**: Data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it

### Your Responsibility

Since all data is local-only:

- **Backups**: You are responsible for backing up your data

- **Lost Device**: Data cannot be recovered remotely if your device is lost

## Data Access and Control

### You Have Complete Control

- **Delete anytime**: Delete individual logs, profiles, or all data
- **Export anytime**: Export your data as PDF, CSV, or JSON
- **No account recovery**: Since there are no accounts, there's nothing to recover
- **Uninstall = Delete**: Uninstalling the app deletes all local data permanently

### Who Can Access Your Data

- **Only you**: On your device with physical access
- **No remote access**: Developers cannot access your data
- **No backdoors**: No mechanisms exist for external data access

## Exported Data

When you export data (PDF, CSV, JSON):

- **You control the file**: The file is created on your device
- **You choose where to share**: You decide who receives the file
- **No automatic uploads**: Files are not uploaded anywhere
- **Secure sharing**: Use secure methods to share with healthcare providers

## Photo and Voice Data
