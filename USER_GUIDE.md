## Evidence Mode

**Evidence Mode** is an advanced feature that adds **legal documentation standards** to your logs for SSDI submission.

### What is Evidence Mode?

Evidence Mode adds:
- 🕐 **Evidence Timestamps**: Immutable timestamps when logs are created
- 🔒 **Log Finalization**: Lock logs to prevent accidental changes
- 📜 **Revision Tracking**: Audit trail of any changes to finalized logs
- 📦 **Submission Packs**: Structured PDF packages for legal submission

### When to Enable Evidence Mode

**Enable Evidence Mode when**:
- You're preparing for SSDI application
- You anticipate appeals or hearings
- You want to maintain evidence integrity
- Your attorney recommends formal documentation

**Don't enable if**:
- You're just casually tracking symptoms
- You're still figuring out your condition
- You make frequent corrections to logs

### How to Enable Evidence Mode

1. Navigate to **Settings**
2. Find **"Evidence Documentation"** section
3. Toggle **"Enable Evidence Mode"**
4. Read and confirm the implications:
   - All new logs will receive evidence timestamps
   - You can finalize logs to make them read-only
   - Changes to finalized logs create revision records

### Evidence Timestamps

**What are they?**
- Timestamps automatically applied to new logs when Evidence Mode is ON
- Shows when the evidence was documented (not when it occurred)
- Cannot be removed once applied

**Why they matter**:
- Demonstrates **contemporaneous documentation** (recorded near the time it happened)
- Shows **consistency** in tracking
- Provides **chronological evidence** trail

**How to see them**:
- Look for "Evidence recorded: [timestamp]" on log screens

### Finalizing Logs

**What is finalization?**
- Marks a log as "complete and accurate"
- Prevents accidental edits or deletions
- Creates a locked record for evidence purposes

**How to finalize**:
1. Open a daily or activity log
2. Review it for accuracy
3. Tap **"Finalize for Evidence"**
4. Confirm you've reviewed the log

**When to finalize**:
- After you've reviewed the log for accuracy
- Before including it in a submission pack
- When your attorney requests locked evidence

**What happens when finalized**:
- ✅ Log becomes read-only
- ✅ Shows "Finalized" badge
- ✅ Records who finalized and when
- ⚠️ Cannot be directly edited (must use revision system)

### Revision Tracking

**What if I need to correct a finalized log?**

Evidence Mode uses a **revision system**:

1. Attempt to edit a finalized log
2. System blocks direct editing
3. Use **"Create Revision"** option instead
4. Provide:
   - Changes to be made
   - Reason for revision
   - Your reviewer notes

5. Revision is recorded with:
   - Timestamp of revision
   - Who made it
   - What changed
   - Why it changed

**Viewing Revision History**:
1. Open a finalized log
2. Tap **"View [X] Revisions"** link
3. Modal shows chronological list of all changes

**Why revisions matter**:
- Maintains **audit trail** for legal proceedings
- Shows **transparency** (not hiding changes)
- Demonstrates **accuracy commitment**

### Submission Packs

**What is a Submission Pack?**

A submission pack is a **structured PDF package** containing:
- Cover page with claimant information
- Table of contents
- Daily logs in standardized narrative format
- Activity logs
- Functional limitations
- Medication list
- Appointment history
- Photo evidence
- RFC (Residual Functional Capacity) summary
- SSA Form 3368 data

**How to Create a Submission Pack**:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → "Evidence Documentation"
   OR **Reports** → "Evidence Submission Packs"

2. Configure the pack:
   - **Date Range**: Select the period to include (e.g., last 90 days)
   - **Symptom Filters**: Choose specific symptoms to include (or all)
   - **Include Only Finalized Logs**: Option to include only locked evidence
   - **Include Photos**: Attach photo evidence
   - **Include Medical Records**: Attach appointment summaries

3. Tap **"Generate Submission Pack"**

4. Review the pack metadata:
   - Number of logs included
   - Date coverage
   - Symptoms documented

5. Tap **"Export PDF"**

6. Save the PDF to your device or share directly

**When to create a submission pack**:
- Initial SSDI application submission
- Reconsideration or appeal
- Attorney request for evidence compilation
- Hearing preparation

**Pro Tips**:
- ✅ Create packs for **specific time periods** (e.g., 90 days, 6 months)

## Tips for SSDI Success

### Documentation Best Practices

**1. Consistency is Key**
- ✅ Log symptoms **every day** or at least 5 days/week
- ✅ Create a **routine** (e.g., log before bed)
- ✅ Don't skip "good days" (SSA needs to see variability)

**2. Be Specific and Quantitative**
- ❌ "I was tired" → ✅ "Fatigue prevented me from preparing meals; needed to lie down for 3 hours"
- ❌ "Pain was bad" → ✅ "Back pain 8/10; couldn't sit for more than 10 minutes"
- ❌ "Hard to concentrate" → ✅ "Brain fog prevented me from reading more than 1 paragraph without forgetting content"

**3. Use Functional Language**
- Focus on **what you cannot do**, not just symptoms
- Example: Instead of "knee pain," write "cannot stand for more than 5 minutes due to knee instability; required sitting breaks every 5 minutes during grocery shopping"

**4. Document Everything**
- ✅ Medications and side effects
- ✅ Doctor visits and recommendations
- ✅ Assistive devices used (cane, walker, shower chair, etc.)
- ✅ Help needed from family/caregivers
- ✅ Activities you've stopped doing

**5. Track Patterns**
- Note **triggers** (weather, activity, stress)
- Document **frequency** (daily, 3x/week, monthly flares)
- Record **duration** (symptoms last 2 hours, 3 days, constant)
- Show **impact** (missed work, cancelled plans, needed ER visit)

### Working with Attorneys

**How the app helps attorneys**:
- Provides **chronological evidence** trail
- Generates **professional narratives** in SSDI language
- Exports **structured data** for SSA forms
- Maintains **audit trail** with Evidence Mode

**What to share with your attorney**:
1. **Full Narrative Reports** (6-12 months)
2. **Submission Packs** (if using Evidence Mode)
3. **CSV exports** (for their own analysis)
4. **RFC reports** (for form completion)

**When to involve your attorney**:
- Before finalizing logs for evidence
- Before creating submission packs
- When generating reports for hearings
- If you need specific date ranges or formats

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Logging only bad days** → Log good days too; SSA needs to see your baseline  
❌ **Vague descriptions** → Be specific with numbers, durations, limitations  
❌ **Skipping context** → Always explain how symptoms impact function  
❌ **Not backing up data** → Back up weekly; losing months of logs is devastating  
❌ **Waiting to enable Evidence Mode** → Enable it early if planning SSDI application  
❌ **Not reviewing reports before submission** → Always review; generated text may need clarification  
❌ **Ignoring medication compliance** → SSA expects you to follow prescribed treatment  
❌ **Logging retrospectively weeks later** → Log same-day for accuracy and credibility
